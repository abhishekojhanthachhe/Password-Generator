# Password-Generator
Generate a random string, mostly to be used as a password.


## How to use
Edit the variable `passowrd["include"]` to include or not include certain types of character in the generated random string.

## Future Plans
1. Add a user interface.
2. Add feature "minimumTwo" which ensures each category of character is included at least twice.
3. Extend "minimumTwo" to minimum n number of characters and make minimum n feature customizable to each type of character
4. Add a graphic user interface.
5. Convert project to HTML and js.
